All malware is encrypted in ZIP archives for your protection and to prevent antivirus from deleting them.

Please do not unzip these files on a real system.

Make sure to disable network access and preferably run these on a system you do not care about, or in a VM without network access (although that is not ideal, you might want to use a physically separate system as opposed to a VM)

Encrypted with `zip` (Zip 3.0, `ZIP(1)`) using the command `zip -re virus.exe.zip virus.exe`

Password is `password`.

# Kali Vagrant VM

This VM has:

- Kalitorify -- run `kalitorify --help`. It is a transparent Tor proxy tool that edits iptables for you.
- Tor Browser helper

Snaps:
 - `snap run android-studio` (android VM)
 - `snap run wickrme` (chat)
 - `snap run discord` (chat)

That's about it. It's Kali. Many uses!
